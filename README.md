# myopia2
The data from 554 children enrolled in the Orinda Longitudinal Study of
Myopia (OLSM) as nonmyopes with baseline data from the third grade were evaluated to
develop a predictive profile for later onset of juvenile myopia [4]. Myopia was defined as at
least -0.75 D of myopia in the vertical and horizontal meridians of the right eye as measured
by cycloplegic autorefraction (n = 45 children).
